qrism is a Rust-based project for generating and reading multicolor QR codes. 
It enhances traditional QR codes by incorporating multiple colors to increase storage capacity, allowing the storage of larger data files like images and PDFs, potentially unlocking new applications. 
The multicolor QR reader is backward-compatible with standard black-and-white QR codes.
